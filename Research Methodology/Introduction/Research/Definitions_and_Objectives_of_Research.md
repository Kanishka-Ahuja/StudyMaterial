## Research Definition:

**Video Content:**
  - Research is very basically **the process of inquiry**, where you are investigating to learn more about a topic, a question.
  - It is **systematic inquiry or search** for information and understanding.
  - In general, it is **generating knowledge and insight**, meaning you are learning more about a situation.
  - It occurs pretty much everywhere; it not only occurs in laboratories, students do research, employers do research, it occurs in workplaces, in boardrooms, in classrooms and street, all kinds of people engage in research.

**From PDF:**
  - _What is Research?_ Authors and Management Gurus have defined research in different ways.
  - Usually, research is said to begin with a question or problem.
  - ***Research is defined as the generation of new concepts, methodologies, and understanding through the creation of new knowledge and/or creative application of new knowledge.***
  - This could include synthesizing and analyzing previous research to the point where it produces new and innovative results.
  - By applying research, we are able to find out the solutions of a problem with the application of systematic and scientific methods.
  - You could talk about experimentation or innovation.
  - You could use the word "risk" to describe the element of danger that comes with discovery.
  - It is possible that investigation will lead to analysis.
  - It is possible that you will conduct tests to prove your hypothesis.
  - You could simply state that this work is unique and never seen.
  - You could discuss what new knowledge will be gained because of your work.
  - You could talk about a new method or a new data source that will result in a breakthrough or a small improvement over current practice.
  - You could state that it is a prerequisite for development in the sense of "research and development".

### Scientific Process of Research:

- Research is a **scientific process**.
- And this scientific process is based on some assumptions, these are:
  - There is a **Universal truth**, so there is some truth that is kind of behind the scene, we can't really get out but our goal is to try to get its closest possible.
  - This means we are assuming that there is an **Orderly Universe**, that there is a pattern to behavior and to the way things work in the world.
  - Those truths are **Discoverable Truths** i.e., if we engage in recess and research properly then we can discover some of these truths.
  - But we will never have complete knowledge of the truth (**Incomplete Knowledge**), we can never learn everything, we can get as close as we can but we never really know what those universal truths are.

- And the research is carried out through:
  - First of all **Observation**, so you observe something you notice, you may notice something that peaks your interest or curiosity or you may wonder why something works the way it does.
  - And then you will create a **Hypotheses** or come up with a question and this is the information that you would like to find out.
  - And at that point you test your hypothesis or **test your questions** in order to find the answers and you will analyze whatever data you gathered.
  - And from the result of your analyses you will **make the inferences**, you will come away with the information that you have learned.

## Objectives of Research:

**From PDF:**
  
  - **General Objectives:**
    - General Objectives, also known as secondary objectives, provide a detailed view of the study's goal.
    - In other words, by the end of your studies, you will have a general idea of what you want to accomplish.
    - For example, if you want to investigate an organization's contribution to environmental sustainability, your broad goal could be to investigate sustainable practices and the organization's use of renewable energy.

  - **Specific Objectives:**
    - Specific objectives define the primary aim of the study.
    - In most cases, general objectives serve as the foundation for identifying specific goals.
    - In other words, specific objectives are defined as general objectives that have been broken down into smaller, logically connected objectives.
    - They assist you in defining the who, what, why, when, and how of your project.
    - It's much easier to develop and carry out a research plan once you have identified the main goal.
    - Take, for example, a study of an organization's contribution to environmental sustainability. The specific goals will be as follows:
      - Determine how the organization has changed practices and adopted new solutions throughout history.
      - To determine the impact of new practices, technology, and strategies on overall effectiveness.
      
## Why we engage in research

- **Satisfy Curiosity**: We people are naturally questioning, we want to know things.
- Research helps us **understand causes of phenomenon**; we observe something and wonder why things happen the way they happen and we want to know their causes.
- If we understand why certain things cause certain other things to occur, then we can **determine cause-effect patterns**, which is very helpful because if we can determine how one thing causes another thing to occur, then we can step in and make changes that will affect this process, so we achieve the results that we might like to achieve.
- **Research answers questions**; sometimes these questions contain very valuable information that we can use in business.
- In this way, we can **improve the world**, and that may sound a little grandiose to improve but we can improve it a bit at a time, even if we just improve the course of how our business operates or we improve our workplace just a bit so that our employees have more better work satisfaction and better job performance, then we are improving things and even just a small incremental improvement is good overall.
- We can **understand events** and this is sort of part of the cause-effect patterns, if we understand events and understand why certain events occur in certain circumstances, then we're better able to create the events that we would like to see occur.
- All part of this is **understanding people's behaviors, their cognition**, so what's going on in their head and their emotions because emotion is a large part of how what drives people to act in certain ways and we ultimately trying to get people to behave the way we want them to behave in order to get the results that we would like to get.

## Why is Research Important in business?

- If we **understand the cause-effect relationship** then we **can minimize risk**, if we know what types of actions are going to cause the other actions or feelings or emotions or cognitions then we can cause the kind of behavior we would like to and minimize causing the type of behavior we would not like to see occur in our business.
- This helps us more quickly **recognize opportunities** and threats, so if we can predict what's going to be happening based on what happened in the past then we are more likely to be able to seize opportunity, a little bit faster maybe than our competitor if we can see that it's coming sooner and this also helps us to avoid threats that may be right around the corner,
- It helps us also **identify our competition**.
- And we can **understand results**; if we understand why things are happening then we can better see how our different initiatives and programs we may enact in business or at work then we will understand what the results are, so we know if our certain training programs or other initiatives if they are successful or not successful so we know if we need to make any changes or improvements.
- Research also helps us to more quickly **identify emerging trends** so we can sort of be on the forefront in taking advantage of this and we can seize our share of market a little bit faster maybe than others who are less quick in identifying what these trends may be.
- So this helps us to **build better market position**.
- **Communication** is also key in research, it helps us to learn what types of needs our clients, customers, employees have in order to better communicate with them and we can understand better through research if we are communicating properly, if they are understanding what we are communicating to them and if we are understanding their needs as well.
- It can also help us **understand buying patterns** which is very important if we can understand why people are buying in the way that they are then we can meet their needs a little bit better, if we can predict these needs we can be on the forefront in meeting those needs so that we can improve or market position.
- We can also use research to **identify employee needs**, the satisfaction and happiness of employees is really key in the success of a business, if you have satisfied and happy employees then you have less likely to have truancy, people coming in late, people quitting and then you have to go the time and expense of hiring new employees, also happy and satisfied employees simply perform better, they are more productive employees so if you can engage in research in order to understand the needs of your employees and maybe some issues that may improve their work attitude then you can build up a more satisfied work force and improve your business.
