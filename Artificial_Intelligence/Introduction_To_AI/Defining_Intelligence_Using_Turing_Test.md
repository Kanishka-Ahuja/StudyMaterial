## Turing Test

* Legendary computer Scientist and Mathematician _Alan Turing_ proposed the Turing Test to define intelligence. 
* It's a test to see if a computer can learn to mimic human behavior.

**Test Setup:**

* To see if a machine can do this, Turing proposed a test setup:
    * A human interrogates a machine through a text interface.
    * The human cannot know who is on the other side of the interrogation (machine or human).

**Setup:**

* A human will be interacting with two entities through a text interface:
    * These two entities are called respondents, one being a human and the other a machine.
* The respondent machine passes the test if the interrogator is unable to tell whether the answers are coming from a machine or a human.

**Why Text Interface?**

* According to Turing, "Physical Simulation of a person is unnecessary for intelligence." This is the reason the Turing Test avoids direct physical interaction between human and machine.
