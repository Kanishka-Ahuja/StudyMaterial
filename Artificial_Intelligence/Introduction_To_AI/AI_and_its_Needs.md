## What is AI?

* **What AI Does:**
    * Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a way to make machines think and behave intelligently (like humans).
    * These machines are controlled by software programs inside them.
* **AI and Software Programs:**
    * So AI has a lot to do with the intelligent software programs that control these machines.
* **AI as a Science:**
    * It can be considered as a science of theories and methodologies that can help machines understand the world and accordingly react to the situation in the same way that humans do.

## Artificial Intelligence and Human Brain

* **Connection to Brain Research:**
    * AI is closely related to the study of the human brain.
* **Understanding the Brain:**
    * Researchers believe that AI can accomplish understanding how the human brain works.
* **Building Intelligent Systems:**
    * By mimicking the way the human brain learns, thinks, and takes action, we can build machines that can do the same.
* **Learning Platforms:**
    * This can be used as a platform to develop intelligent systems that are capable of learning.

## Need of AI

* **Impact on Our Lives:**
    * AI has the ability to impact every aspect of our lives.
* **Goals of AI:**
    * The field of AI tries to understand patterns and behaviors of entities.
    * With AI, we want to:
        * Build smart systems
        * Gain a deeper understanding of intelligence itself
* **Understanding Intelligence:**  
    * The intelligent system that we construct are very useful in understanding how an intelligent system like the brain constructs another intelligent system.

## Conversion of Raw Data to Wisdom
**Data** -_Processed_-> **Information** -_Cognition_-> **Knowledge** -_Pattern Extraction_-> **Understanding** -_Inheritance_-> **Intelligence**
<br><br>
Data is processed and gets converted into information which when understood becomes knowledge and when we extract the pattern of this knowledge we understand it, which when understood gives intelligence.
(Which when you try to do this with machine you see that it falls way behind.)

## Presently

(One of the main reasons to study AI is to automate many things)

* **Data Challenges:**
    * We live in a world where we deal with huge and insurmountable amounts of data.
    * The human brain can't keep track of so much data.
    * Data originates from multiple sources simultaneously.
    * The data is unorganized and chaotic.
    * Knowledge derived from this data has to be updated constantly because data itself keeps changing.
    * The sensing and actuation have to happen in real time with high precision.

## Expected Activities

* **Machine Capabilities:**
    * We need to design and develop intelligent machines that can do various activities like:
        * Handling large amounts of data efficiently.
        * Ingesting data simultaneously from various sources without any lag.
        * Indexing and organizing data in a way that allows us to drive insights.
        * Learning from new data and updating constantly using the right learning algorithms.
        * Thinking and responding to situations based on real-time conditions.
* **Improving Existing Machines:**
    * Artificial intelligence techniques are actively being used to make existing machines smarter so that they can execute faster and more efficiently.
