## Understanding Different AI Systems

* **Computer Vision:**
  * These systems deal with visual data such as images and videos.
  * They understand the content and extract insights based on the use case.
  * **Example:** Google uses reverse image search to search for visually similar images across the web.

* **Natural Language Processing:**
  * This field deals with understanding text.
  * We can interact with a machine by typing natural sentences.

* **Speech Recognition:**
  * These systems are capable of hearing and understanding spoken words.
  * **Example:** There are intelligent personal assistants on our smartphones.

* **Expert Systems:**
  * These systems use AI techniques to mimic human experts in specific domains like finance, medicine, or marketing.
  * They rely on a knowledge base containing facts and rules gathered from human experts.
  * When a user interacts with the system, it retrieves relevant information from the knowledge base and applies the stored rules to provide advice or make decisions.

**Database and Training** 

* **Games:**
  * AI is used extensively in the gaming industry to design intelligent agents that can compete with humans.

* **Robotics:**
  * Robotic systems actually combine many concepts in AI.
  * These systems are able to perform many different tasks depending on how the robots have sensors and actuators that can do different things.

## Choosing the Right AI Tool

It is important to understand the various fields of study within AI so that we can choose the right framework to solve a given real-world problem. Here are some key areas:

* Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition
* Logic-Based AI
* Search
* Knowledge Representation
* Planning
* Heuristics
* Genetic Programming

## Core AI Techniques

* **Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition:**
  * The most popular form of AI.
  * Design and develop software that can learn from data.
  * Based on this learning model, we perform predictions on unknown data based on learning.
  * This is how a typical Machine Learning system looks:
Data -> Preprocessing -> Training -> Optimization -> Machine Learning Model
  * When a system makes an observation, it is trained to compare it to what it has already seen in the form of patterns.

* **Logic-Based AI:**
  * A program that uses logic-based AI is basically a set of statements in logical form that express facts and rules about a particular problem domain.
  * This is used extensively in pattern matching, language parsing, semantic analysis, and so on.

* **Search:**
  * Search techniques are used extensively in AI programs.
  * These programs examine a large number of possibilities and then pick the most optimal path.
  * For example, search techniques are used a lot in strategy games such as chess.

* **Knowledge Representation:**
  * The facts about the world around us need to be represented in some way to make sense of them.
  * If the knowledge is represented efficiently, systems can be smarter and more intelligent.
  * The diagram shows the difference between Information and Knowledge
    <br> **Information**
    <br> + + + + 
    <br> <br> **Knowledge**
    <br>    +-+-+-+

* **Planning:**
  * This field deals with optimal planning.
  * This field gives us maximum returns with minimal costs.
  * These software programs start with the facts about the particular situation and a statement of the goal.

* **Heuristics:**
  * A heuristic is a technique used to solve a problem that's practical and useful in solving problems in the short term, but not guaranteed to be optimal.
  * Heuristics are used extensively in AI fields such as robotics and search engines.

* **Genetic Programming:**
  * Genetic programming is a way to get programs to solve a task by mating the programs and selecting the fittest.
  * The programs are encoded as a set of genes.
  * An algorithm is used to get a program that performs the given task very well.
